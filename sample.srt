1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,490
Young people are the solutions for tomorrow.

2
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:08,519
Young people are the solutions for all the
worries.

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,530
Young people, if you stay with them,
you will be full of energetic.

4
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:21,910
But the advice I give to the young people
is also the advice I give to myself.

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:25,130
That nothing is easy.

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:26,830
Nothing is free.

7
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:31,180
If you want to be successful, you have to
pay the price.

8
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:41,030
Alibaba 18 years to today's size,
yeah we are lucky, but we work much harder!

9
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:42,629
Than most of the people!

10
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:46,280
We never sleep well and sound in the evening.

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:53,489
I traveled last year 867 hours a year, in
the plane.

12
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:57,638
I'm working hard, my team is working very
hard.

13
00:00:57,639 --> 00:01:03,309
18 years we work like normal company 70 years.

14
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:05,080
Day and night.

15
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:09,030
Nothing is free.

16
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,009
Nothing is easy.

17
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:16,079
You have to think different, you have to do
different.

18
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:22,429
Early days in my company, when some ideas
come to my desk,

19
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:28,899
"Jack this a great idea!" and I look at everybody,
everybody say it is a good idea, I normally

20
00:01:28,899 --> 00:01:30,859
threw it into the rubbish.

21
00:01:30,859 --> 00:01:32,009
Because everybody says it is good.

22
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,430
Then all the other people thinking, if everybody
says this is gonna be very tough,

23
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:41,729
I'm very interested in that tough question
and I pick up and say,

24
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:44,119
"How can we do it in a different way?"

25
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:48,600
This is to be unique, to be different.

26
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:56,009
And the third, this is my advice and this
is also, I'm telling myself every day.

27
00:01:56,009 --> 00:02:03,119
Today is very tough, tomorrow is tougher,
the day after tomorrow is beautiful,

28
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,999
but most people die tomorrow evening.

29
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:11,709
You have to work very hard, every tough day,
every tough situation,

30
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:16,680
problems you meet, that is the training of
yourself.

31
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,159
When you graduate in your school, you just
started your career of learning.

32
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:30,370
When you got a PhD diploma, a bachelor diploma,
this is just a certificate your parents paid

33
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:32,150
the tuition.

34
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,590
For 4 years.

35
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:39,209
Your real challenge is when you leave the
college, the real life starts,

36
00:02:39,209 --> 00:02:42,980
the real exam starts, the real test starts.

37
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,410
That's life!

38
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:52,100
So, one thing you are lucky as I said, if
students cannot survive,

39
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:55,340
99.9% of people in the world cannot survive.

40
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:01,849
Only you have this confidence, you will be
able to face the challenge of future.

41
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:12,320
If you have 20-30 years, please find a good
boss, not necessarily a good company,

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,489
learn from the boss, learn how to do it.

43
00:03:15,489 --> 00:03:22,330
When you're 30-40 years old, try to do something
yourself, if you really wanna try.

44
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:29,160
When you're 40-50 years old, do things that
you are good at,

45
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,219
after 20 years of learning you should do something
you're good at.

46
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:40,030
When you're 50-60 years old, spend your time
supporting young people.

47
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:45,050
When you are over 60 years old, spend time
with your grandchildren.

48
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:47,520
That is normally a lot of people like that.

49
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:51,849
So when you are a graduate or when you're
just in the university, don't think about,

50
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:59,280
"I want resign from the school and be another
Bill Gates, because Bill Gates left Harvard."

51
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,180
There's only one Bill Gates in the world.

52
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,459
When you graduate find a company,
most important find a good boss, that can

53
00:04:07,459 --> 00:04:09,920
train you, discipline you.

54
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,280
Tell you what is good and right.

55
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,430
It's more important than a good company.

56
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,350
Of course, a good company, a good boss even
better.

57
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:19,140
And then, continue your life.

58
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,630
It's all about a partner.
